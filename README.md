This project is a Facial Emotion Detection and Emoji Suggestion System built with a user-friendly Streamlit web interface. It uses computer vision and deep learning techniques to detect human emotions in real-time from facial expressions captured via webcam or uploaded images. Once an emotion is identified, the app automatically suggests an appropriate emoji that matches the user's current mood.

The model is trained using TensorFlow/Keras on a labeled dataset of facial expressions. It classifies emotions such as happy, sad, angry, surprised, neutral, and more. For image processing and face detection, OpenCV is used. The intuitive Streamlit interface allows users to interact with the system effortlessly, either by uploading a photo or using their webcam directly within the browser.
